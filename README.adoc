This is the CodeReady Toolchain Registration Service repository. It implements the registration flow for the Toolchain SaaS.

== Build

Requires Go version 1.16 - download for your development environment https://golang.org/dl/[here].

This repository uses https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules[Go modules]. You may need to `export GO111MODULE=on` to turn modules support "on".

To build, execute:

```
make build
```

This builds the executable with bundled assets. Only the binary needs to be deployed, all static assets are bundled with the binary.

To just generate the asset bundle, execute:

```
make generate
```

This creates the asset bundle in the `static` package. Do not change the asset bundle file(s), changes will be lost on the next build.

== Development

To make development on the static content easier, a development binary can be built using:

```
make build-dev
```

The resulting binare *does not use bundled assets* but reads static content directly from `pkg/assets`. *Do not deploy the dev binary*. 



=== Tests

Tests are run by executing:

```
make test
```

Tests are run with bundled assets, see above.

=== VSCode Testing/Debugging

To use the internal test runner and debug features of VSCode, you need to make sure that VSCode runs in a context where Go Modules are enabled. To do this, run:

```
export GO111MODULE=on
```

Before running VSCode from that shell.
