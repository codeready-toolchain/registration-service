This is the Developer Sandbox Registration Service repository. It implements the registration flow for the Toolchain SaaS.

== Build

Requires Go version 1.19.x (1.19.7 or higher) - download for your development environment https://golang.org/dl/[here].

This repository uses https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules[Go modules].

To build, execute:

```
make build
```

This builds the executable with bundled assets. Only the binary needs to be deployed, all static assets are bundled with the binary.


== Development

To make development on the static content easier, use the `./scripts/deploy-dev.sh` shell script with the following commands:

```
$ ./scripts/deploy-dev.sh setup
```
to setup the access to the Container Registry running within the OpenShift cluster accessed via `$KUBECONFIG` and scale down the deployment to 1 replicas

```
$ ./scripts/deploy-dev.sh setup
```
to build the binary, package into an Image, push it to the Container Registry and update the deployment.


=== Tests

Tests are run by executing:

```
make test
```

Tests are run with bundled assets, see above.

=== VSCode Testing/Debugging

To use the internal test runner and debug features of VSCode, you need to make sure that VSCode runs in a context where Go Modules are enabled. To do this, run:

```
export GO111MODULE=on
```

Before running VSCode from that shell.
