This is the CodeReady Toolchain Registration Service repository. It implements the registration flow for the Toolchain SaaS.

== Build

Requires Go version 1.13 - download for your development environment https://golang.org/dl/[here].

This repository uses https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules[Go modules]. You may need to `export GO111MODULE=on` to turn modules support "on".

To build, execute:

```
make build
```

This builds the executable with bundled assets. Only the binary needs to be deployed, all static assets are bundled with the binary.

To just generate the asset bundle, execute:

```
make generate
```

This creates the asset bundle in the `static` package. Do not change the asset bundle file(s), changes will be lost on the next build.

== Development

To make development on the static content easier, a development binary can be built using:

```
make build-dev
```

The resulting binare *does not use bundled assets* but reads static content directly from `pkg/assets`. *Do not deploy the dev binary*. 



=== Tests

Tests are run by executing:

```
make test
```

Tests are run with bundled assets, see above.

=== VSCode Testing/Debugging

To use the internal test runner and debug features of VSCode, you need to make sure that VSCode runs in a context where Go Modules are enabled. To do this, run:

```
export GO111MODULE=on
```

Before running VSCode from that shell.

=== Deploying on minishift without operators

To deploy Registration Service only (no operator deployed) on local minishift, start your minishift then run:

```bash
eval $(minishift docker-env)
make deploy-dev
```

The service can be accessed via the corresponding route:
```bash
$ oc get routes registration-service

NAME                   HOST/PORT                                                            PATH      SERVICES               PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
registration-service   registration-service-toolchain-host-operator.192.168.42.237.nip.io             registration-service   8080                    None
```

You can now open the URL from HOST/PORT in your browser:

http://registration-service-toolchain-host-operator.192.168.42.237.nip.io

_Note_: the actual route/URL will be different in your minishift.

=== Deploying all operators and Registration Service

All e2e resources such as Host operator, Member operator, Registration Service, CRDs, etc can be deployed via:

```
make deploy-e2e
```

Host and member operators will be downloaded from the `master` branch and the local `registration-service` repo will be used to deploy the Registration Service.

By default this target deploys resources to `toolchain-host-operator` and `toolchain-member-operator` namespaces.

NOTE: If running in Minishift `eval $(minishift docker-env)` and `eval $(minishift oc-env)` are required. If running in CodeReady Containers `eval $(crc oc-env)` is required.
